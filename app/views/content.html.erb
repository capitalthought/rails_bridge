<!-- 

To put your own templating content into this section, create the following view in your views path:

<default_views_path>/rails_bridge/layout_bridge/layouts/<%= @layou_name %>/content.html.erb

You may also override individual partials to be used for this templatized layout by creating them with the same relative path under

app/rails_bridge/layout_bridge/views

Any partials declared in this directory will have precedence over those in your default views path.
